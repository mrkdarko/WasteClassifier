# WasteClassifier
Classifies Waste based on the 5 main kinds
This project involves creating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify waste into five categories: organic, hazardous, recyclable, solid, and liquid. The model is trained on image datasets and utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning

For Web scraping
Automates the process of searching and downloading images from Google Images.
- Handles dynamically loaded JavaScript content using Selenium.
- Saves images in their original formats while avoiding duplicates.
- Implements robust error handling for failed downloads and network issues.

## Prerequisites
1. Python 3.x
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install selenium pillow requests

For running model
1.	Install Dependencies:
2.	pip install tensorflow matplotlib
3.	Prepare the Dataset:
o	Organize the dataset in the waste_dataset/ directory with subdirectories for each category under train/ and val/.
4.	Run the Script: Execute the waste_classification_cnn.py script to train and evaluate the model.
5.	View Results: Check the plots in the plots/ directory for training and validation performance.
